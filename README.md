# Test
My first steps on the path of developers...

Welcome on this repository !

After few weeks of learning HTML/CSS/PHP, I finally tried to create my own website !

The entire part of the work that I'll do here will be use for the <strong>"Adamant"</strong> project. My goal is to allow people to make us know what
they think about our website and what we can do to improve it.
If you never have heard of this project, you have to go at <a href="http://adamant.ga">Adamant</a> right now !

So here you'll be able to see a beginner developer trying to use all the knowledge he had got, and especially the changing of mood during coding with the commits !



Enjoy it !
