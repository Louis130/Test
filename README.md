# Test
My first steps on the path of developers...

Welcome on this repository !

After few weeks of learning HTML/CSS/PHP, I finally tried to create my own website !

The entire part of the work that I'll do here will be use for the <strong>"Adamant"</strong> project. 
If you never have heard of this project, you have to go at Adamant.ga right now !

So here you'll be able to see a beginner developer trying to use all the knowledge he had got, and especially the changing of mood during coding !



Enjoy it !
